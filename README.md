## Historical sources
Use cases presented to asses the PeGaZus ontology and KG construction method are the followings.
### Addresses use case
TO BE ADD
### Plots use case
**Sources**
* Napoleonic land registry of Gentilly (1810-1848) inclusing cadastral index maps and mutation registers (Departemental Archives of Val-de-Marne)
* Napoleonic land registry of Gentilly (1845-1860) inclusing cadastral index maps and mutation registers (Departemental Archives of Val-de-Marne and Paris Archives)

**RDF Resources creation**
* Geometries : Plots have been digitized by hand using georeferenced cadastral index maps of previous project. This includes :
    * Vectorization of the plots
    * Association of each plot with a plot number
* Other informations have been transcribed by hand in several mutation registers
* Sources (maps and registers) object have been created using archives metadata
